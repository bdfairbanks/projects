        <p><b>Bowieism</b><br>
            Many were saddened by the death of David Bowie in 2016.  Not to fear though, as The Thin White Duke was simply creating one more character.  He has been reincarnated as a cat, 
            and as the worship of the androgynous one has become the mainstay religion of everyone that <italic>I</italic> know, now is the time to investigate Cat Cults so the adoration of the Only Living 
            Starman can continue uninterrupted. </p>

        <p><b>Teh Interwebs</b><br>
            The internet is the greatest site of cat worship ever to exist in the known world.  Through it's interlocking series of tubes cat lovers can revel, ogle and evangelize all 
            from the comfort of their own homes.  Truly now is the age of light. </p>
    
        <p><b>Giant Cats Of AKTP!!!(Formerly the Soviet Republic of Aserbajad)</b><br>
            In the prosperous and moral land of AKTP!!!(Many Donkey, no Goat) there lives a race of wise and much revered giant cats.  The people of AKTP!!!(Donkey good, Goat, no.) 
            live in peaceful coexistence with these majestic deities, and enjoy their council on many important issues, such as vacuum cleaner policy and why can't we catch that 
            red dot.  The AKTP!!!ians (No. Goat.) provide great spread to their honered councilcats, and participate in time-honored ceremonies, such as the rarely photographed
            cat dance.</p>
