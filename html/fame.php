        <p> <b>Garfield</b><br>
        Garfield is perhaps the most famous cat of all time, although he is a fictional character.  This makes him outside our interest.</p>
    
    
    
        <p> <b>Maru</b><br>
        Maru is a cat that lives in Japan.  He has become famous for his frolicking and antics on the internet. He is a good cat.

        <p><b>Simon</b><br>
        Simon was a great, if underpromoted cat.  Simon served in the British Royal Navy as they stuck their nose someplace they had no business sticking it, (again) the Chinese Civil War.
        Simons nose, however was right where it should have been, killing rats and getting pets.  Simon was injured during his service on the HMS <i>Amethyst</i>, but got right off the sick
        bed to kill the rest of the vermin that were infesting the ship. For his ratting and morale raising skills Simon was given the Dickin Medal, the only cat to have earned it.
        He was also told that he was a very good cat.</p>
